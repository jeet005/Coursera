#### Q1. Which information is needed to create a virtual private cloud (VPC)?

- [ ] The Availability Zone that the VPC will reside in.
- [ ] The subnet that the VPC will reside in.
- [x] The AWS Region that the VPC will reside in.
- [ ] The group of subnets that the VPC will reside in.

Correct  
When a solutions architect creates a VPC, they need to specify the AWS Region that it will reside in, the IP range for the VPC, and the name of the VPC. For more information, see the Introduction to Amazon VPC video.

#### Q2. Which of the following can a route table be attached to?

- [ ] AWS Accounts
- [ ] Availability Zone
- [x] Subnets
- [ ] Regions

Correct  
A route table contains a set of rules (which are called routes) that determine where network traffic from a subnet or gateway is directed. Each subnet in a virtual private cloud (VPC) must be associated with a particular route table. For more information, see the Amazon VPC Routing video.

#### Q3. A company wants to allow resources in a public subnet to communicate with the internet. Which of the following must the company do to meet this requirement?

- [ ] Create a route to a private subnet
- [x] Attach an internet gateway to their VPC
- [x] Create a route in a route table to the internet gateway
- [ ] A and B
- [ ] B and C

Correct  
Unlike a modem at home, which can go down or go offline, an internet gateway is highly available and scalable. After the company creates an internet gateway, they then need to attach it to a virtual private cloud (VPC) and create a route table to route network traffic through the internet gateway. For more information, see the Introduction to Amazon VPC reading.

#### Q4. What is the compute as a service (CaaS) model?

- [ ] The CaaS model requires that users purchase virtual machines and manually provision servers to run a workload.
- [x] The CaaS model offers computing resources (such as virtual machines that run on servers in data centers) on demand, by using virtual services.
- [ ] The CaaS model offers large discounts for computing resources. However, users must run the workload from the server that is stored on-premises.
- [ ] The CaaS model delivers cloud-based applications to users across the globe, over the internet.

Correct  
The CaaS model provides virtual computing resources on demand. For more information, see the Compute as a Service on AWS video.

#### Q7. What is the difference between using AWS Fargate or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) as the compute platform for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)?

- [x] With AWS Fargate, AWS manages and provisions the underlying infrastructure for hosting containers.
- [ ] With Amazon ECS on Amazon EC2, AWS manages and provisions the underlying EC2 instance for containers.
- [ ] With AWS Fargate, users need to manage cluster capacity and scaling.
- [ ] With Amazon ECS on Amazon EC2, users need to upload only the source code. Amazon ECS takes care of the rest.

Correct  
With Fargate, users donâ€™t need to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. For more information, see Container Services on AWS.

#### Q8. Which statement about serverless is TRUE?

- [ ] Users must provision and manage servers.
- [ ] Users must manually scale serverless resources.
- [x] Users do not pay for idle resources.
- [ ] Users must manage availability and fault tolerance.

Correct  
Serverless architectures only incur a charge when they are in use and resources are being consumed. For more information, see the What is Serverless video.

#### Q9. True or False: AWS Lambda is always the best solution when running applications on AWS.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

Correct  
AWS Lambda is a good solution for running on-demand workloads with runtimes of under 15 minutes, without needing to provision and manage servers. However, it does not fit all use cases. For more information, see the Choose the Right Compute Service video.

#### Q10. Which compute service does Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provide?

- [ ] Container services
- [ ] Serverless
- [x] Virtual machines (VMs)
- [ ] Analytics

Correct  
Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. For more information, see Reading: Compute as a Service on AWS.

#### Q11. Which stage of the instance lifecycle is an instance in when the account starts to accumulate charges?

- [ ] When an instance is in a pending stage
- [x] When an instance is in a running stage
- [ ] When an instance is stopped
- [ ] When an instance is terminated

Correct  
Users start accumulating charges for instance usage when their instance is running. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Instance Lifecycle.

#### Q12. Which component of the c5.4xlarge instance determines the instance family and generation number?

- [ ] 4x
- [ ] Large
- [ ] 4xlarge
- [x] c5
